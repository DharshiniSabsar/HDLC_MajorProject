Problem Statement: 

Developing a functionality to connect a form to a database using PHP and MySQL, allowing users
to submit and store applicant information, including attributes such as applicant name, gender,
qualification, age, date of birth, etc. The form will utilize HTML for input fields and PHP for
establishing the connection to the database.

Description: 

The objective is to create a form that enables users to enter applicant details and submit them for
storage in a MySQL database. The form will include input fields for attributes such as applicant
name, gender, qualification, specialisation subject(use options), age, and date of birth. Upon
submission, the PHP script will validate the input data and establish a connection with the MySQL
database to store the information securely.
The HTML form will be designed to capture the applicant details, utilizing appropriate input field
types (text, select, date, etc.) to ensure accurate data entry. The PHP script will handle form
submission, validate the input for completeness and correctness, and establish a connection with
the MySQL database.

Key Requirements:
1. Design an HTML form with input fields for attributes like applicant name, gender, qualification,
age, and date of birth.
2. Utilize appropriate HTML input field types and attributes for each attribute, ensuring data
integrity and usability.
3. Implement PHP code to validate the form inputs, checking for completeness and correctness
before proceeding.
4. Establish a connection to the MySQL database using PHP and appropriate database credentials.
5. Create a table in the MySQL database to store the applicant information, defining the appropriate
columns and data types.
6. Insert the validated applicant data into the MySQL database table upon successful form
submission.
